Gooooood Evening, 

you receive that message for the reason that you 
support / participate /waste time /burn money /made profit
in the past on one of my Projects or on all Shit/Fun/Scam Releases ^^

the reason for that message... i just wanna say thank you for the support,
in the past 3 Months i figured out some fancy ideas and during that process 
the Project went from "could be interesting" into "oO wtf it`s working".

however,  lets skip the bla bla fancy idea part, and comes to an end.

Project-X isn't Mine-able and basicly doesn't let the user Stake coins to generate interest. 
The User can rent Mining-Contracts or re-invest his Coins which get exchanged into
Company Shares which grants fixed payouts + Interest Rates, free scalable for 
short or long term investments....

so far nothing special,  but Project-X just generate coins which are send to the user,
or based on the amount of sold Shares / Mining Contracts. 
any coin which is produced over the limit is getting destroyed full automatic 
instantly by the system itself.


Aaaaannnnndddd now.. let me say Thank You for your spend time in the past. 
you can download the Alpha-Version Client here: https://github.com/Tillkoeln/x/releases
if you generate a deposit address and send me the address, you will receive
a lifetime Slot on the Mining-Contract System, which grants you hourly free
Coins without do anything else. 


There arent any official Infos or Announce Threads curently available during
the Alpha-Test.... if the current Stress-Test on the Blockchain/Network 
is suceful  we switch into Beta mode including official Announce and Promotion. 




kindly regards 
Tillkoeln
